##3.1 

The nascent RNA signal likely represents the general levels of transcription occurring within a given nucleus. The PCNA signal likely represents levels of DNA replication within a given nucleus. The Log2 ratio represents the ratio of transcription to replication within a nucleus. 

##3.2 

Apex1 has the highest log2ratio. This makes sense given that Apex1 encodes an important DNA repair endonucleuase that repairs replication-preventing DNA damage sites. Thus, when knocked down, these damaged sites go unrepaired, reducing replication levels in these cells, and thus increasing the transcription:replication ratio. 

SRSF1 has the lowest log2ratio. This makes sense given that this gene is involved in RNA splicing. Thus, when knocked down, nascent transcript formation is likely decreased, reducing the transcription:replication ratio.
